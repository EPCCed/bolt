# System description
#
# This section sets system wide configurations for the 
# resource
#------------------------------------------------------------------
[system info]

# The name of the system and a short description of the 
# compute architecture (only used for information 
# purposes)
system name:           FERMI
system description:    IBM-BlueGene/Q

# Specify the shell definition line that will be placed
# at the top of every job submission script
job script shell:      #!/bin/bash

# Specify the batch system name - the name must correcpond
# to the name of a system defined in the corresponding batch
# system configuration files
batch system:          LL_BGQ

# Total number of compute nodes on the system (currently used
# to calculate the number of cores available for information
# purposes only)
total nodes:           10240

# Are job submission scripts required to set an account ID option
# (usually for charging purposes). 
account code required: yes

# If no account code is specified what is the default value
# (if any). If the string 'group' is used then the tool will
# set the account code as the user's *nix group name. Any
# other string will be used as the default. If this option is
# not specified then there will be no default. Users 
# can override the default by using the appropriate command
# line option.
default account code: PRACE_staff

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Node definition
#
# This section specifies the hardware layout of the nodes in 
# terms of number of sockets, dies (NUMA regions) per socket
# and cores per die.
#
# Cores per node = sockets * dies per socket * cores per die
#------------------------------------------------------------------
[node info]

# The number of physical processor sockets per node
sockets per node:      1

# The number of dies (or NUMA regoins) per socket
dies per socket:      1

# The number of cores per die
cores per die:         16

# The number of threads per core (hyperthreading)
threads per core:      4

# Does each job have exclusive access to a compute node (even
# if it uses less than the total number of cores per node) or
# can different jobs share compute nodes
exclusive node access: yes

# Specify the type of accelerator cards (if any) on the node
# (not currently used)
accelerator type:

[general parallel jobs]

# Specify whether or not parallel jobs are available
parallel jobs:              yes

# Specify whether or not parallel jobs are available
hybrid jobs:                yes

# The maximum number of parallel tasks allowed for a single job
maximum tasks:              32768

# The minimum number of parallel tasks needed for a single job
minimum tasks:              1024

# The maximum job duration (in whole hours) allowed for parallel jobs
maximum job duration:       1-64:1,65-2048:24

# The format that the parallel job time will be printed in in
# the job submission script. Valid values are:
#   + hms = hh:mm:ss
#   + hours
#   + seconds
parallel time format:       hms

# The preferred spacing between parallel task placement on a node
# (if the number of tasks per node specified allows this 
# flexibility and the job launcher supports task placement at
# this level).
preferred task stride:      1

# Define how parallel resources are rquested in a batch script. Valid
# values are:
#  + 'tasks' - Number of tasks is used
#  + 'nodes' - Number of nodes is used
parallel reservation unit:  nodes    ; can be 'tasks' or 'nodes'

# The command line option to the job launcher command that specifies
# the number of parallel tasks
number of tasks option:     -n

# The command line option to the job launcher command that specifies
# the number of nodes to use
number of nodes option:

# Do we want to use the batch system to specify the distribution of
# tasks? This is only usually needed if your system does not have 
# an explicit parallel job launcher command and the batch system 
# launches the parallel job instead (for example, LoadLeveller on
# some IBM Power systems)
